This folder will contain the plug-in specific documentation.

Following sub-folders should be made available:
*   Requirements documentation
*   Design documentation
*   Test documentation
 
In case documentation is made in Latex (or some other 'compilable syntax'):
Each folder should contain both the source file (to allow further editing)
and the generated PDF (for reading).
